# Welcome to my first-ever Personal Website!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Made for Presentation

As a personal website, I created this project in-order to showcase many of my projects, such as:

### Artwork

A collection of artwork I've done between early 2024 to current 2025, planned to be actively changing as I continue to create!

### Video Games

As a practicing game developer, I present to you a few of my more recent video game-related projects!

**Note: All game projects are either in-development or mere concepts. Despite this, I am excited to share the workings behind them!**
